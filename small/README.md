# Some other program

In this section there are three programms:

-primi.py: it tells all the prime number under an entered value;

-GCD: it says the Greates Common Divisor between a list of values through the Euclidian algorithm;

-game1: it's a little game in whitch you have to position the numbers so they grow, you only have one free space.
