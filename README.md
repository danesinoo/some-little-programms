This programm play 1 milion mathces at poker Texas hold 'em in 1'30'', with my computer,
which isn't really powerful. 
You insert your cards, say how many players are in the game and then it starts the count.
It's easily manageable, so you can insert the cards in the center of the table as you're 
playing
